# EX.-NO-2-C-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DIFFIE-HELLMAN-KEY-EXCHANGE-ALGORITHM

## AIM:
To implement the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm using C language.

## ALGORITHM:
  
  STEP-1: Both Alice and Bob shares the same public keys g and p.
  
  STEP-2: Alice selects a random public key a.
  
  STEP-3: Alice computes his secret key A as g a mod p.
  
  STEP-4: Then Alice sends A to Bob.
  
  STEP-5: Similarly Bob also selects a public key b and computes his secret key as B and sends the same back to Alice.
  
  STEP-6: Now both of them compute their common secret key as the other oneâ€™s secret key power of a mod p.
  
## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm had been successfully implemented using C
